# Struktur Data
This course provide students to know the structure of data storage in memory so that it is more efficient from a program perspective. This course is a compulsory subject and college students can contract this course in the third semester.

## Course Ojectives
The aim of this course is for students to be able to make programs with data structures that are effective in memory usage to produce good programs.

## Practicum
This course is accompanied by a practicum which will help increase students' understanding and skills in creating and implementing data structures in a programming language, the practicum will be accompanied by assistants lecturer who have been selected by the course lecturer herself.
